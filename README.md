sencha-todolist
===============

It's a basic todo list app developed completely in Sencha Touch 2. The basic motivation was to learn the workings of the framework and the MVC pattern of Sencha.

To use the code, just install a web server (if you dont have one running ) and copy the folder to the root of the server and then access the folder via browser. You should see the Application up and running.

Used Technologies :
1. Sencha CMD 
2. Secnha Touch framework
3. Wamp server
4. Win 8.1 Pro x64
