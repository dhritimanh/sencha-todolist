sencha-todolist
===============

It's a basic todo list app developed completely in Sencha Touch 2. The basic motivation was to learn the workings of the framework and the MVC pattern of Sencha.

To use the code, just install a web server (if you dont have one running ) and copy the folder to the root of the server and then access the folder via browser. You should see the Application up and running.

The todolist Functions :

2. To delete an added Todo, double click it.
3. The todo List persists between browser refreshes.
